# Meal Suggestion Application

This is a simple Android application built using Kotlin and programmatic layout (no XML). It suggests a meal based on the time of day entered by the user.

## Features

- Input time of day (e.g., **morning**, **mid-morning**, **afternoon**, etc.)
- Get a meal suggestion based on your input
- Display the meal suggestion clearly on screen
- Maintain a scrollable history of suggestions
- Reset the app to start again
- Validates input and gives feedback for incorrect values
- Colorful and clean UI with user-friendly layout

##  Meal Suggestions

| Time of Day         | Meal Suggestion               |

| Morning             | Breakfast (Eggs)              |
| Mid-morning         | Light Snack (Fruit)           |
| Afternoon           | Lunch (Sandwich)              |
| Afternoon Snack     | Afternoon Snack (Cake)        |
